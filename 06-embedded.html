                <p>The last time I heard about the ohms law was about 3 years ago during my 'O' levels. Ever since, I've forgotten everything related to physics due to the fact that I am not interested in it a single bit. However, this module brought back some memories about physics. Despite learning about it for 4 years, I still had to relearn everything about electronics. The ohms law is the most basic and important rule as it is the formula to whether my circuit works or fails. It also allows me to check whether I have my wires connected to the correct ports.</p>

                <p>I've heard about arduino but did not know that they were so many variations of it. Arduino is basically a component that communicates between input and output devices. They can be powered via usb or other external power sources.</p>

                <p>The top row terminals are meant for input devices such as push bottoms, pir sensors, light dependent resistors while the bottom row terminals are meant for analog devices;</p>

                <p>To code arduino boards, an arduino ide program is used and the language used is in c++. Above is the starting screen of the software. To ensure the arduino board is able to read the codes, a number of checks has to be done. First, make sure the software is connected to the correct board and port. Second, click the 'tick' button to see whether there are any errors in the codes. And lastly, click upload to make the project come to life.</p>

                <p>Above is an example of a blinking led project. Coding in the setup function only works after every reset of the arduino board while the coding in the loop function works continuosly. </p>

                <p>Above is another example of a buzzer alarm project. There are many ways to tweak the project, for example changing the sound, delay and even adding more input/output devices.</p>
