                <img class="img-final" src="img final/1.png">
                <p>Ideation: Version 1 - I initially wanted to create a motion sensored lamp with a lamp shade. The plan was to create a lamp that switches on when there is a motion and switches off when there is another motion.</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/2.png">
                <p>Ideation: Version 2 - However, I ran out of time and could not figure out the coding aspect of the project. Hence, I decided to change the rationale of the project. I decided to create a small imaginary companion that switches on when there is a motion. It acts as a simple mood lifter that can be placed beside you. It can also act as a way to distarct your mind from problems.</p>

                <p>Bill of materials</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/13.png">
                <p>Model of base in Fusion360. I decided to use the same idea and technique as my previous music box project.</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/4.png">
                <p>Laser cutting process. I had to laser cut the same design twice as the first try did not cut the plywood fully.</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/5.png">
                <p>Fully assembled box. Although the box could stay intact without glue, I decided to just glue it together for durability.</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/14.png">
                <p>Model of led pedestal in Fusion360.</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/6.png">
                <p>3D printing process. I had to print this pedestal three times as the first two times, the print came out either too thin or too thick.</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/7.png">
                <p>Finished product. I later coloured it green to fit the theme.</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/15.png">
                <p>Coding for the arduino nano</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/8.png">
                <p>Trial and testing whether the pir sensor works.</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/9.png">
                <p>The issue I countered with was that one of the sensors was faulty and my computer was unable to recognise one of them. This led me to taking the longest time wondering what was wrong with my coding, to the point I tried reconnecting the wires to different ports many times. Just to find out one of the sensors was faulty and my coding was right all this time.</p>
                <img class="img-final" src="img final/10.png">
                <p>I tried to cable manage by taping the wires together to make the inside of the box neater </p>

                <p>Final outcome of the inside.</p>

                <p>Things I could have done better:</p>
                <p>1. I could have done a better job in making the design more accessible</p>
                <p>2. A brighter LED or neopixel strip could have been used</p>
                <p>3. I could have spent more time in trying to pursue version 1 of my ideation</p>
                <p>---</p>
                <p>Overall, this project has been fun but time consuming coming from somebody who has no prior knowledge coming into this elective. Although it was cool to know the many possibilies embedded programming can offer and to see my progress from the start of sem 2 to the end, I don't see myself using it in the near future unfortunately. However, it has been an eye opening experience learning from the lecturer. </p>
